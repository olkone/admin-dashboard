# Admin Dashboard

**Check out the Admin Dashboard [live webpage](https://olkone.github.io/admin-dashboard/)!**

## About
This dashboard was created with HTML and SCSS as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.


## App Features
* Conveniently see all of the most important and relevant information on your personal dashboard.
* As new information is collected, the flexbox layout will add to your feed seamlessly.
* Access the most important links on the fixed side bar no matter where you are on the webpage.
* View important announcements and trends.
* Preview posts, and interact with their links.

## Code Features
*The following features were the main concepts I learned and implemented in this project.*

### HTML & (S)CSS:

* When to use grid and flexbox most effectively
* Nested grids and flexbox
* CSS selectors
* Nested Sass structure
* Using relative and fixed units appropriately
* Using functions such as min, max, minmax

## Reflection
This was my most complex webpage layout yet. The main focus for me was combining flexbox and grid display to make a dynamic, responsive, and organized webpage.
<br><br>
These are the contexts for grid and flexbox I found to work well.

* Grid:
    * Overall body structure
    * Section structure
    * Small sections where an element needs to span more or less space than another
        * Large profile picture with the greeting

* Flexbox:
    * Main content section
    * One-dimensional rows and columns
        * Side bar list
        * Inner conent structure
        * Announcement and Trending structure
        * Header inner structure

## Improvements and Feature Ideas
* Make the layout mobile-friendly
    * Media queries, clamps
* Toggle between dark/light mode
    * Detect user preference
* Add infinite scroll with JS
* Gather automatically display and update API data in dashboard
* Make the search bar and buttons functional

## Development Tools
